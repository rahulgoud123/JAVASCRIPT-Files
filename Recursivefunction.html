    <p>A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. Recursive functions are commonly used in programming when a problem can be broken down into smaller, identical sub-poblems. Each recursive call processes a smaller instance of the problem until a base is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns a result.</p>
