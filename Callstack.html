    <p>Javascript uses a call stack to track the functions in a program. The call stack works on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently called function will be the first to be completed. Whenever a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the stack.</p>

<script>
    //call stack
    function first(){
        return "first";
    }
    function second(){
        return first()+"second"
    }
    second()
</script>
